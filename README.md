Digital Mental Wellness Platform Focus : Student Engagement
SDG Aligning with: 3 - GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

Brief Introduction
Our project "WaveLength" is focused on SDG 3 and students' mental health. It is a mental wellness and anonymous counseling platform designed mainly to support students. We aim to create a platform for students who NEED emotional and practical support. It aims to create a safe and interactive mental health awareness and peer support space. The platform provides dedicated features for students and volunteers, enabling collaboration and fostering a supportive community.

Causes and Case Studies
The mental health of students has become a growing concern in recent years, with rising cases of stress, anxiety, depression, and suicides. The pressure to excel academically, societal expectations, and competitive environments often create overwhelming stress. Factors such as bullying, lack of support systems, financial strain, and the stigma surrounding mental health further exacerbate the issue. Additionally, the overuse of social media contributes to feelings of inadequacy and isolation. The absence of open conversations and accessible mental health resources leaves many students feeling helpless, highlighting the urgent need for safe spaces, counseling, and awareness to foster a supportive environment.
